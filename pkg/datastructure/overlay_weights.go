/*
Customizable Route Planning In Road Networks, Delling et al., Page 11:
First, for each cell C in the overlay graph, we keep three integers: pC (the number of entry points), qC
(the number of exit points), and fC (the position in W where the first entry of Câ€™s matrix is represented).
During customization and queries, the cost of the shortcut between the i-th entry point and the j-th exit
point of C will be stored in W [fC + iqC + j].
